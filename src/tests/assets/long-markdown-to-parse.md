# There were a set of things about radical behaviorism

- Tolman himself attributes behaviorism as an ism to Watson.

# Historically, however, there were a longer historical contexts for behaviorism

# Behaviorism came out of it and changed it as well

<|Control>

- wasn't made it explicit that behaviorism was about control with the science of control
- Skinner also expressed similar things that the use of knowledge is to make it possible to control

- in the control was to take place through environment

- the most radical of the people, Kuo even insist that your environment could shape the individuals so much that there is no sense of talking about name instinct and nature

- What is controlled and how.

<250|mechanism>

- as a major influence on Wasson, Jacques Loeb reject the sentimental understanding of behaviors, and prefer a mechanistic explanation

<250|Intelligence>

# Morgan's intelligence was a specific sense of intelligence

{{"id":"7a97da0f-8647-465a-84de-1feb013d1dd3","modified":"2022-07-10T04:57:19.000Z","sourceCiteKey":"MorIntroduction94","sourcePage":7}}

# Morgan's intelligence and Canon were reified

- Wasson was rejecting Jennings and yet Jennings was in agreement with Morgan and was concerned with evolutionism rather than static

{{"id":"2834d21c-c9ca-48ba-bea8-77445eea1269","modified":"2022-07-11T21:17:04.000Z","sourceCiteKey":"PauLoeb-Jennings81","sourcePage":5}}

- An important early piece by Morgan that laid the foundation for a specific concept of intelligence for studying animal behaviors while denying higher faculties. It also differnetiates between animal and human and further insists on the DISCONTINUITY between them, in agreement with earlier concepts such as Sydney Smith’s quoted in the piece.

{{"id":"4d725d43-a7b9-40b3-8590-1f4e550962fd","modified":"2022-07-10T06:36:09.000Z","sourceCiteKey":"MorLimits93","sourcePage":0}}

- Morgan himself did not reject the possibility of animal higher faculties
- but he himself does show ambiguities- In many places, Morgan shows similar dismissal of animal intelligence that goes beyond “methodological” reductionism in his canon.

- In other words, Morgan insists there must be animals that lacks higher faculties, but not ALL and certainly higher faculties can develop from lower ones. We just cann’t simply start from the higher faculty, because it assumes too much and is unscientific

# J## Lloyd Morgan: intelligence as the ability to adapt

- Intelligence = a feeling about what to do but not why and how it works. It proceeds by trial and error.

- Really clear example of a relegation of trial and error from the realm of knowledge to the realm of intelligence.

- intelligence = actions as the results of experience and association. Also implied that association is not real knowledge. Perception of relations is real knwoledge.

# Spencer's notion

- Crucial idea of SINGLE LINEAR developmeent from instinct to reason.

- Critical: Spencer’s LINEAR notion of the progression of faculty: complex faculty must evolve from simpler ones.

- Complex relationships are built upon simpler relationships.

- This is why Morgan insts on LOW AND HIGH, and asks go lower whenever possible in the CANON.

{{"id":"661196a5-4d99-475d-a027-fcdbdb28303b","modified":"2022-07-11T19:10:53.000Z","sourceCiteKey":"SpePrinciples55","sourcePage":538}}

- the things that the nature of intelligence of real intelligence comes from grasp of relationships come from Spencer

- but after all Morgan's conception of intelligence is rather limited and not as expensive as even some of the behaviorists noted more notably,Tolman. For example Tolman believe that rats can't grasp relationships and causalities

- How Spencer’s idea of intelligence and higher/lower faculty was inherited by Morgan?

- If we consider the fact that intelligence is deeply connected to the perception of causal relationships and such a understanding comes from reinforcement through trial and error, then we see that intelligence is deeply associated with learning.

- Reification

- This is flipping the downgrading of Morgan’s principle where methodology was mistaken for ontology on its head by arguing that analytic simplicity is not genetic primacy.

- The nature of learning was taken by behaviorism as trial and error and it has history.

- Originally came from Math, but Bain was actually deriving from observing animal

- there was a evolutionary route

-
- Bain was also basing his theory about the linkeage between emotion and action through observing animals.

<| Spencer>

- Important source of influence for Conwy Llyod Morgan, especially re. 1. the LINEAR progression from instinct to Reason, 2. proto-idea of learning through reinforcement, 3. a special notion of intelligence as an adaptive relationship to the environment and the correspondence between internal and external relations, which is NOT reason and therefore became later a middle-level faculty for animal studies.

<|Beast machine>

## Morgan's canon allowed the "lowering" of animal intelligence, which was held by Thorndike

## as a result of Morgan's cannon, there was a tendency to treat animals as mechanistic and this was joined by another tradition of treating animals as robots and automata

- the history can be traced back to René Descartes and John Locke

- reflex action = lowest form of psychical life

- A rebuttal by Wesley against Thorndike, especially around whether animals are “automata”, the artificial experiments, and whether there is “imitation” in learning. This shows an early critique of methodological behaviorism and some assumptions, e.g. animals are automata.

- For Dewey, behaviorism redeems psychology by showing social institutions to be responsible for “transforming” human instincts.

- A great analysis of the double-bind of a new mechanistic philosophy/psychology of man: one the one hand, one has lost god and on the other, the belief that man can be “worked” makes humanitity savable

  <|War and Psychology>
- and let's not forget that it was a time of war
- Intelligence as a fitness for war

- Wartime intelligence test: Robert Yerkes and the filtering of the feeblminded and eugenic education

- Watson, Thorndike, and Lashley participated active during the war, mainly responsible to mental fortitude test and selecting aviators
- THe aim of recruitment test is to eliminate the ps

- A second use: to test the psychological capacity of new recruits.

- Waston, Thorndike, and Yerkes all served on the committee

- Yerkes included a report by Waston who was responsible for researching ways to measure fitness of personel for aviation. They built a tank for this purpose, supposedly to test performance under air-pressure.

- Yerkes made it clear that psychology as a science became instrumentally useful for dealing with the “human factor”:

<250 |Purpose was replaced by Reward-seeking>

- purpose was replaced by the idea of reward

- if we look at Thorndike we see that he use the term will. So we could still see how this idea was connected to the sense that there was a higher purpose guiding pleasure and pain. gradually the idea of a whale disappeared and then was replaced by an empty since of will that assessing the disguised desire
    - here I'm thinking of also the passage of the idea of purpose from animal learning to cybernetics we are so very idea of purpose disappeared and was emptied out of content

-
- and the most radical of the psychologists trait purpose as nonexistent or extremely drive driven.

- Skinner called this the specter of ideological question.

- Clean this sentence, he thinks Thorndike\s law is saying that the behavior was able to pass on, that is it was be able to be reinforced, it was because it adapted better

- so the author was concerned with the purpose of action, and how do we makesense of organisms dictation to have an effect, and how is utility represented in behavior

- Critical. Tolman’s representative work that espouses a “molar” behaviorism against Waston’s molecular behaviorism of physiological reductionism, where behavior-acts are guided by purposes and cognition which are further guided by the organism as a whole. Of special relevance to our project is the part V on critique of learning in behaviorism, such as trial and error and Law of Effect.

- Behavior as behavior is molar in that it’s purposive and cognitive.

- Tolman’s behavior is molar behavior, not reducible to pure physiological motions.

- Tolman: learning is not mechanistic trial and error, but the building up of sign-gestalts, i.e. sign to significance or action to consequences.

- I still need to think about the implication of Tolman’s rejection of Morgan’s canon.

# The situation of radical behaviorism

- The situation was unnatural

- 这是一个激进的行为主义，他的一大特点就是把生物和他的环境割裂开，然后把他的环境抽象画变得非常的简单的单一。

- 并且也不考虑动物的复杂的历史。

- Hunger is often given as the situation

- Caged: used in name of scienticitiy.

- Alone: few studies animals together.

- What was really new was the lack of interest about the inside.
